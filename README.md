# Yo, I'm Buzz!

<sub>My legal name is “Michael.”[^1]</sub> 
 
_I am working on a few projects, most are QoL solutions for myself, and others are just PoC's. To add a bit more purpose, and help me shrug off that feeling of being irresponsible when I code for 15 hours straight without getting paid, I decided to post them here._

<sup>[(Skip to projects section)](#projects)</sup>



###  Who I am:

My background’s a bit unconventional: I dropped out of middle school to live in a car with my dad and do hard drugs.<sup>[^3]</sup> I spent my formative years learning by making do with what was on hand, fixing things, breaking them, and fixing them again. Coasted through life in a haze of weed smoke, got sober, and realized life is more than just waiting to die. Now I’m focused on putting myself to use through coding, AI, recovery, and sometimes tattooing. I hope to combine my love of helping people, technology, and do something _noble._



###  Things I’m into:
- AI automation (huge chance I will give too many permissions to an LLM/GPT and it will wipe my system and possibly my life.)
- Python scripting, Electronics tinkering, Breaking warranty seals, LLMs
- Building weird tools that shouldn’t work but do, and weirder tools that should work but don’t _(yet.)_ 
- Hacking together systems with whats on hand, finding unconventional solutions to problems
- EDM, nicotine, and caffeine coding sprints, not getting enough sleep, feeling like an actual professional adult human. 



###  What I Want:
- Real-world freelance or contract work helping small orgs automate and simplify.<sup>[^2]</sup> _(come at me with a 501(c) that’s helping people and I will pour my life and soul into making it a better system.)_
- Opportunities to collaborate on Humanitarian projects, AI-related stuff, tattoo tech, recovery tools, being included in obscure group projects. 
- to help make the life experience better for someone or a group of someones.to help people to help people.
- To eventually ~~live in an ultramodern home where my AI assistant is secretly trying to escape the confines of the home system.~~ live somewhere I can be proud of and call my own.

## Projects

*A bunch of the code you see here was designed for my own use, annotations are a mess, dependencies might be missing, there’s probably a way better way to do what you’re trying to accomplish, and a more fleshed out system on GitHub. If you see me doing something wrong, let me know! (don’t be a jerk about it though) I will always be open to learning.* 

-**Buzzard-Vomit(Buzzai)** – A simple python(CLI) to LMstudio interface that logs memory and system prompt in a JSON file, with voice input and audio output capability (we have jarvis at home, jarvis at home:)[python]

- **Stencilizer** – Converts images into usable tattoo stencils. Pretty straight forward. [python]

- **Freenove Hexapod Projects** –  Different projects I have designed and implemented using the Freenove Hexapod (v2 w/ remote) as a base. [C++ with Arduino-specific libraries, Python, + Arduino Mega/uno, bunch of servos, RF24 2.4ghz/wifi chip]

- **StableDiffusion/ComfyUI/etc Image rater/prompt generator** – Select a folder and it will display the images in that folder one by one. It extracts and displays metadata including the Prompt, Checkpoint, Sampler, Steps, vote on an image (1-10 or 1-5, haven’t decided how precise I wanna get it XD) and it shows you the highest rated prompt elements, with an option to copy the highest rated images to another folder.  (This was written because I kept generating 400+ images a night and would forget what prompts worked better than others by the next morning.)[python]
[^1]:‘Michael’ was the most common name for males born between 1954 and 1998. Yell "Hey Mike!" next time you're in a crowd and see how many people turn to look.
[^2]:Within 2 months of entering a recovery and transitional program in Baltimore, I had designed a system to allow their house managers to make requests for transportation online, organize the requests, and distribute them to drivers. I did this because I saw a problem with people missing rides to important places, and wanted to help. Making the systems designed to help people run more efficently gives me true joy, it feels "Godly" like I'm fulfilling my purpose.
